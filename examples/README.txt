This is a file containing instructions about the executing the codes example1 and example2.

Example1:
	
	Description: This is a sample code to show the usage of different functions in the toolbox.
	Input      : The input to be given to the code is the number of threads to be run in the parallel region when prompted.
	Output     : Execution of given number of threads in parallel region and printing the sequence of execution. 
				 Also printing the output of different functions.

Example2:
	
	Description: This is a sample program which usses the function mat_mul in the toolbox to multiply two matrices parallely.
				 Also it utilizes get_wtime function of the toolbox to calculate the time taken to execute the code.
	Input	   : The input to be given to the code is the size of the matrices and the matrices itself when prompted.
				 Matrices should be given in a multidimesional array with each row ending with a semicolon and each element seperated by a comma.
				 
					sample input:
					[1,2,3;4,5,6;7,8,9;] for 3 cross 3 matrix.
	Output	   : The output of the program is answer of the matrix multiplication and the time taken to execute the whole program.
